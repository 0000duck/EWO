This software is built using the SolidWorks API and makes use of the Horn's method for absolute orientation in robotics implemented by Matt J: https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26186-absolute-orientation-horn-s-method

Improved versions of this software are in production ans they are coming soon.

THERE ARE KNOWN ISSUES with the proper orientation for the welding torch which are currently being fixed.
